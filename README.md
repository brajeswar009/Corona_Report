## General info
This project is completely build with python. This uses the api provided by this amazing website [https://corona.lmao.ninja/](https://corona.lmao.ninja/) to fetch real-time covid-19 details.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.7 or higher (3.8.5 recommended)
* requests library: 2.25.1
* tkinter
* any IDE can be used but VS Code is recommended.
	
## Setup
To run this project, fisrt install python from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).
After successful installation of python, install requests library using pip command.
```
$ pip install requests
```
To make it easier I have attached the requirments.txt file from which all required libraries can be installed at once.
```
$ python -m pip install -r requirments.txt
```

Now you are good to go. Having knowledge on requests library, tkinter module and general usage of json is an added benefit but you can use google for any need as I did.

## Features!

  - Smooth experience with good user interaction.
  - User can refersh the page to get up-to-date details.


You can also:
  - Minimize or close the display any time you want.


## Status
This project is finished for the time being. But if some idea comes up to my mind this will be reflected into it.

## Inspiration
I got this idea from the various news portal who tend to show real-time corona details on their homepage so I used https://corona.lmao.ninja/ api to get the similar result.
